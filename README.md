# thepovmethod
A method for generating shared purpose on teams of specialists.  
For a given question …
Have everyone on the team provide 3 potential answers on 3 separate post-it notes
These answers are each team member’s V1 IPOV, which is an individual point of view, which is a strong opinion that motivates action but is held losely enough that it can evolve in light of better intelligence.  Everyone deserves the right to upgrade their POV as soon as they get smarter.  
Form 2-person partnerships and determine partner A
Partner A shares their 3 answers
Partner B “plays back” what Partner A shared until Partner A agrees that Partner B understands their answers.  
Allow room for answers to evolve in real time.  
Partner B shares their 3 answers 
Partner A “plays back” what Partner B shared until Partner B agrees that Partner A understands their answers.
Allow room for answers to evolve in real time.  
After sharing between partners A and B in what we can call the “listening to creatively assist” model, each participant is given a second opportunity to write three new answers to the question.  They can stick with their V1 IPOV, or they can upgrade it to reflect new intelligence gained by listening to creatively assist with a peer.  Plagiarism is encouraged.  If either partner likes the language or thinking of the other better than their own, they are encouraged to adopt and mimic it.
All team members share their V2 IPOVS with all other team members, one at a time.  
As each shares, others support their ideation cycle the way a rhythm section of a jazz band supports the improvisational solo of a soloist.  The process is non-adversarial and actively conspires to help the soloist improvise their best ideas.
Listeners are encouraged to write down anything they hear from other team members POVs so they have these items as reference points for the 3rd iteration of drafting their POV.
A moderator can engage in creative listening with each person sharing their V2 IPOV and capture any “important observations” on a whiteboard.
After listening to all ideas from all team members, and using captured notes and “important observations” captured by the moderator, each person has a 3rd and final chance to require their POV, or 3 answers.  
Once composed, each team member places their 3 final answers on a common whiteboard (or LucidSpark board), and then interested team members conduct an “affinity mapping” exercise where similar post-it’s are grouped together.  
There is usually one large grouping that outweighs the rest.  This is the first GPOV, of Group Point of View.  It is where everyone is looking at the same idea and thinking two things:  (1) that is the right idea, and (2) that is MY idea.  There may be a second grouping.  Sometimes there are even 3, but it’s more normal that the 3rd group is a collection of otherwise divergent ideas that didn’t gain group support.  
If the group is suspicious of their GPOV and worries that it is more collectively stupid than intelligent, they can do an “attack the GPOV” session where they state all the reasons why the GPOV might be incorrect.  Then they can re-run the IPOV—>GPOV process from the ground up.
Creative listening or listening to creatively assist or “comping” the ideological soloist is a process whereby words give clues to thoughts and thoughts/words give clues to realizations that form the IPOV.  When supporting another this way, the goal is to augment their creative process with additional intellectual cycles while staying oriented towards the big idea they are attempting to express.  
The entire process anticipates the collective realization of a new and better idea that is greater than the sum of the contributing ideas of team members.
